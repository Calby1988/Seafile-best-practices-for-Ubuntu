# Introduction
It's nice to get mails from your server when something is wrong or you just maybe want a application to send you a mail with a logfile or something.
But it's not so nice when you need a hole mail server, but we can use ssmtp and that's a application that allows you to only send mails from your server but it will send it trough some other mail service.
So it's like Outlook or Thunderbird but for servers.
In this guide we are going to use Gmail to send mail from.

## Installation
First we need to instll it.
```
 sudo apt-get install ssmtp
```
