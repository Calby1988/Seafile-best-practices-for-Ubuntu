Well, I'm a user of Seafile and I love it, it's much faster then for example Nextcloud but as it's not so much documentation around it I'm going to change that.
So I have been starting this project that will only use the best practices for Seafile when it's running on Ubuntu server.
I'll start with a guide on English then make one in Swedish as Swedish is my native speaking language.

Your welcome to upload your own translation of this guide here on my GitHub so we can collect all of it on the same site.
