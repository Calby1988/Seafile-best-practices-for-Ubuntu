# Introduction
As I have written many guides, I need to save some time. So I have made this document seperated so I can just link to it from the guides to save time and also when I need to change something I can just do it in one document.<br>
What we are going to do here is that we are going to secure NGINX with Fail2Ban filters that are adopted for NGINX.
I also writting the Fail2Ban filter for SSH in this guide as we all want to protect our SSH.
