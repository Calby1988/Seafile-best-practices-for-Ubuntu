# Introduction
If you want multiple servers over the HTTP and HTTPS port and you only have one (WAN)(INTERNET) IP you need a reverse proxy that can route the traffic to the correct server. The good thing here is that you can have everything on the reverse proxy, the protection and also the SSL certs etc. You can host this server on it's own machine or simpley on a VM.
